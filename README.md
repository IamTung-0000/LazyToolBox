Many thanks to SLEIPNIR for his original idea and lasso scripts!<br />

i have update and modified SLEIPNIR's script with an user interface with a HTML5 panel with on/off button and add some other functions to fasten up my workflow.
the script is pretty simple but useful, the interface talk with adobe extend script through Adobe Common Extensibility Platform.
